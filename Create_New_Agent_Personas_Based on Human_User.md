Defining the "Persona"

I'm still exploring the user's concept of a "persona app." The provided code snippets suggest a focus on natural language processing, but the specific application remains unclear. I need more context to understand how the chat history will be used to create these personas. I am leaning towards exploring NLP approaches.

Defining "Persona" Further

I've clarified the user's intent. The core idea is to leverage AI-powered agents and their chat histories to construct distinct "personas." The focus appears to be on adapting and re-purposing existing AI agent technology, particularly the UAgI framework, to create these personas. I am leaning toward using the agnoMultiAgent_digest as the foundation, tailoring agents to specific characterizations.

Building the Foundation

I'm now focusing on establishing a concrete structure for the "persona app." The user's goal seems to be creating AI agents with distinct personalities based on defined roles and instructions, drawing on previous agent work. I've broken down the core requirements into a persona definition system, a chat interface, and the necessary backend logic for agent instantiation and session management. I'm leaning toward adapting the UAgI framework, specifically agnoMultiAgent_digest.txt, as the core for this application.

Structuring the Persona

I'm now zeroing in on defining the application's core architecture. The user intends to build an application for AI personas grounded in chat history. I am currently formulating the components needed: a persona definition system (including name, role, instructions, knowledge), a chat interface for user interaction, session management to maintain chat history and context, and the backend for agent instantiation. The existing UAgI framework, particularly AgnoMCP_Agent, appears as a likely foundation.

Developing the Framework

I am now focusing on refining the persona definition system for the application. The user is aiming to develop an application that can build and host AI personas. I'm leaning toward creating a modular system, allowing users to define and customize each persona's name, role, instructions, and knowledge base. Building on Agno_MCP_Agent.txt, I plan to simplify the model selection, making it a streamlined process that integrates with the Streamlit interface.

Refining the Approach

I'm now focusing on a more streamlined design. The user's intention is to build an app for creating personas based on chat history. I plan to use the Agno_MCP_Agent.txt structure as a foundation and refine it. I will implement a persona definition system with a Streamlit front end, and simplify the model selection process, using history as context.

Analyzing the User's Vision

I'm now fully immersed in the nuances of the user's intent. The direction is clear: a "PersonaChat" app, built from Agno_MCP_Agent.txt, but streamlined. I will focus on a user-friendly Streamlit interface and an adaptable persona_agent.py to allow the user to define their AI personas through descriptions, instructions, and optional chat history "seeds". Simplification will be key.

Building the Application

I've started building the PersonaChat app. My focus is now on streamlining the implementation. Leveraging the structure from Agno_MCP_Agent.txt, I'm creating persona_agent.py to handle agent creation and employing a simplified Streamlit UI with adaptable functionalities. I'm prioritizing user-friendly persona definition with name, description, and instructions, along with optional history input to refine agent personas. I'll utilize SQLite for session management, drawing from the Agno_MCP_Agent.txt implementation.

Constructing the PersonaChat

I've transitioned to building the PersonaChat application. My focus is on a user-friendly Streamlit front end. I am creating persona_agent.py for agent creation, and I am developing a modular system for defining personas: name, description, and instructions, alongside an option to include chat history "seeds." I will utilize SQLite for session management as in Agno_MCP_Agent.txt.

Constructing the Core

I'm now focusing on a more streamlined design. The objective is to build an application for defining and interacting with AI personas, built on chat history. I plan to use the Agno_MCP_Agent.txt structure as a foundation, refine it, and introduce a user-friendly Streamlit front end. I will implement a persona definition system with a simple model selection using history as context.

Designing the Application

I've transitioned to a streamlined approach, focusing on a user-friendly "PersonaChat" app. My aim is to build a simplified agent creator with a robust Streamlit UI, drawing heavily from the foundational structure of Agno_MCP_Agent.txt. The new focus is on flexible persona definitions with optional chat history integration, all handled within a single persona_agent.py file. I will use SQLite.

Constructing the Core Application

I've transitioned to a streamlined approach, focusing on building a user-friendly "PersonaChat" app. My aim is to build a simplified agent creator with a robust Streamlit UI. I'm focusing on flexible persona definitions with optional chat history integration, all handled within a single persona_agent.py file. I'll use SQLite for session management, drawing inspiration from Agno_MCP_Agent.txt, simplifying the model selection process and implementing a user-friendly Streamlit front-end.

Refining the Implementation

I'm now focusing on a more streamlined design. The objective is to build an application for defining and interacting with AI personas. I plan to use a more simplified structure, refining the persona_agent.py and the Streamlit UI to offer a streamlined user experience, enhancing persona definition with name, description, and instructions and adding the ability to upload a chat history "seed." I will use SQLite.

Of course! I can help you build an application that uses AI chat history to create and interact with different personas. This application will allow you to define a persona for an AI agent, including its name, description, and behavioral instructions. A unique feature will be the ability to provide a "seed" chat history, which the agent will use to learn its conversational style and personality.

Here are the files for the "PersonaChat" application.

# PersonaChat: Create and Chat with AI Personas

PersonaChat is a Streamlit application that allows you to create, customize, and interact with AI-powered personas. You can define an agent's personality through a name, a detailed description, and specific instructions.

A key feature of PersonaChat is the ability to "seed" a persona with an example chat history. By providing a sample conversation, you can guide the agent's tone, style, and voice, making the interaction feel more natural and aligned with the persona you envision.

## 🌟 Features

-   **Customizable Personas**: Define the name, description, and instructions for your AI agent.
-   **Seed with Chat History**: Upload a text file with a sample conversation to give your persona a unique voice.
-   **Multiple LLM Providers**: Support for various models from providers like OpenAI.
-   **Session Management**: Automatically saves your conversations.
-   **Chat History**: Maintains the context of your conversation with each persona.
-   **Export Conversations**: You can export your chat history as a markdown file.

Help me build an AI chat history used to create persona app. Let me explain more.

There are a repository of a thousand questions that have been studied to show that answering those questinos have best created a like persona of a user. It is very cumbersome to answer as an individual. Current AI like CHatGPT and Gemini save chat histories. Create an application that can answer these questions as best as it can based on what it could assume from the chat history. The app may benefit from haveing multiple steps to create an intermediary persona but I will leave that up to you. The end product is a saved paired QA json file.

Of course. This is a fascinating and powerful project. You want to build an application that ingests a user's chat history, creates a "persona" based on it, and then uses that persona to automatically answer the 1000 introspective questions. The goal is to generate a rich, consistent, and human-like personality profile without the user having to manually answer every question.

Your attached files, especially thousand_questions_agent_builder.py and the implementation plans, provide an excellent architectural foundation. I will use their core concepts—like the structured AgentPersonality and the categorized questions—to build a robust, AI-driven version of this system.

Here is a complete plan and codebase for building the AI Persona Builder.

Project Overview
The application will work in a two-step command-line process:

Persona Profiling: An AI model will analyze the provided chat history to create a detailed personality profile. This profile will capture the user's core traits, communication style, knowledge domains, and a narrative summary. This becomes the "intermediary persona" you mentioned.
Question Answering: A second AI process will use the generated persona profile as its "mindset." It will then proceed to answer all 1000 questions as that persona, ensuring consistency and a coherent worldview.
The final output will be a single, well-structured JSON file containing each question paired with its AI-generated answer.

# AI Persona Builder

This application uses AI to build a rich, consistent personality profile by answering the "Thousand Questions" based on a user's existing chat history.

## Overview

The process is designed to simulate a personality by first understanding a user from their conversations and then applying that understanding to answer a deep, introspective questionnaire.

**The process works in two main steps:**

1.  **`profile`**: This command reads a chat history file and uses a powerful AI model to generate a structured `persona_profile.json`. This profile includes core personality traits, communication style, knowledge domains, and more.

2.  **`answer`**: This command takes the generated `persona_profile.json` and the `Thousand_Questions.txt` file. It then instructs an AI to answer every single question *as that persona*, ensuring all answers are consistent with the defined profile.

The final output is a JSON file containing all 1000 questions and their AI-generated answers.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- An OpenAI API key (or another compatible LLM provider)

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository and navigate to the `persona_builder` directory.**

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your API key:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
    ```

5.  **Prepare your data:**
    - Place the `Thousand_Questions.txt` file in the `source_data/` directory.
    - Place your chat history file (e.g., `my_chat_history.txt`) in the `chat_histories/` directory.

## Usage

The application is run from the command line.

### Step 1: Generate the Persona Profile

Run the `profile` command, providing the path to your chat history file.

```bash
python main.py profile "chat_histories/sample_chat_history.txt"
This will analyze the chat history and create a persona_profile.json file in the outputs/ directory.

Step 2: Generate the Answers
Run the answer command, providing the path to the persona profile you just created.

Bash

python main.py answer "outputs/persona_profile.json"
This will begin the process of answering all 1000 questions. It will show a progress bar and save the final answered_questions.json in the outputs/ directory upon completion. The process is resumable; if it's interrupted, it will pick up where it left off.

Enhanced AI Persona Builder

Executive Summary

This specification refines and extends the original two‑step CLI prototype (persona profiling ➜ question answering) into a modular, test‑driven toolkit capable of transforming any chat history into a richly‑structured persona profile and a complete 1 000‑question Q&A knowledge base. Key goals:



Higher answer quality & consistency via multi‑pass reasoning (draft → critique → finalise).

Scalability & resilience with async batching, local caching, resumable checkpoints, and pluggable vector stores.

Observability through structured logging, metrics, and automated consistency audits.

Extensibility—new question banks, LLM providers, or personality models can be added with minimal friction.

Module Details

1 · profiling.profiler.PersonaProfiler

Pass 1 – Synopsis: summarise chat in ≤500 tokens.

Pass 2 – Trait Inference: output Big‑Five (0‑1), DISC quadrant, motivation drivers.

Pass 3 – Schema Check: ensure required keys; regenerate missing fields.

All passes share a common PromptContext object so system instructions are centrally updated.



2 · prompting.forge.PromptForge

Chooses template family per question category (introspective, factual, relational).

Injects few‑shot exemplars auto‑sampled from high‑confidence prior answers.

Adds chain‑of‑thought scaffold when --cot flag enabled.

3 · answering.answerer.QuestionAnswerer

Async gather() on batches of 10–25 Qs.

Automatic cache (SQLite/duckdb) keyed by (model, persona_hash, question_hash).

Self‑reflection loop:

draft = LLM("Answer succinctly…")

critique = LLM("Identify factual or logical flaws in ↓ draft …")

final = LLM("Rewrite the answer fixing issues listed above…")

4 · answering.consistency

Constructs a simple knowledge graph:



(Q42)──related_to──(Q57)

▲ └──contradicts──(Q311)

Edges defined by category, theme metadata, or explicit related_questions[]. Uses mini‑LM embeddings to score semantic similarity; contradictions flagged for manual or automatic revision.

Prompt Engineering Highlights

System prompt hardness escalates if persona drift detected.

Few‑shot exemplars use message‑delimited JSON to guarantee parseability.

Offensive content & policy compliance checked with a lightweight moderation endpoint before write‑back.

Testing & Quality Gates

90 % unit‑test coverage required (pytest --cov).

pytest‑recording fixture to cache LLM calls inside CI.

Consistency score ≥0.80 across paired questions is enforced; pipeline fails otherwise.

Deployment & Ops

Publish as PyPI package: pip install ai‑persona‑builder.

Docker image with slim Python 3.11.

Optional FastAPI wrapper exposing /profile, /answer, /validate endpoints for web UI integration.

Excellent. The context provided, especially the "Enhanced AI Persona Builder" specification and the "Complementary Data Sources" catalogue, elevates this project from a simple script to a robust, enterprise-grade system. You are asking for a master plan—a technical design specification that an AI engineering team (or a powerful agentic AI) could use to build this application with precision and clarity.

This document serves as that plan. It synthesizes your vision, the provided specifications, and best practices in software and AI engineering into a comprehensive blueprint.

Technical Design & Implementation Specification: Sentient Persona Fabricator (SPF)
Document ID: SPF-TDS-20250615-v1.0
Status: FINAL
Author: O2 Builder (AI Architect)
Key Stakeholders: Genesis Prime Development Team
Relevant Documents: Enhanced AI Persona Builder, Complementary Data Sources for Persona Construction, Thousand_Questions_Implementation_Plan.md
1.0 Principle Directives
This system, the Sentient Persona Fabricator (SPF), will be constructed upon five core principles:

Fidelity & Consistency: The primary goal is to produce a high-fidelity persona whose answers are internally consistent. The multi-pass reasoning (Draft -> Critique -> Refine) and graph-based consistency validation are non-negotiable architectural components.
Scalability & Resilience: The system must process large data volumes (terabytes of chat history) and answer thousands of questions without failure. All processing shall be asynchronous, batched, cached, and resumable.
Modularity & Extensibility: Each component of the architecture must be a self-contained, swappable module with clearly defined interfaces. This allows for future extension with new data sources, LLM providers, or personality models without re-architecting the core.
Observability: The system's internal state must be transparent at all times. This will be achieved through structured (JSON) logging, exported metrics, and detailed progress reporting.
Privacy & Security by Design: Every data ingestion pipeline must include hooks for PII redaction, consent management, and data provenance tracking. The system will operate on a principle of least-privilege access to data.
2.0 System Architecture & Data Flow
The SPF operates as a sequential data-processing pipeline, transforming unstructured text into a structured, queryable knowledge base.

Ingestion & Staging (io module):

Input: Raw data source (e.g., chat history .txt, email .mbox, GitHub API endpoint).
Process: The appropriate Loader (e.g., ChatLoader, EmailLoader) is invoked. It cleans, segments, and redacts the source data, yielding a stream of Document objects.
Output: A collection of standardized Document objects, each with text content and metadata (source, timestamp, author). These are stored in a staging area (local cache or vector DB).
Persona Profiling (profiling module):

Input: A collection of Document objects.
Process: The PersonaProfiler executes a three-pass analysis:
Pass 1 (Synopsis): Generates a concise narrative summary of the input documents.
Pass 2 (Trait Inference): Scores the persona against defined personality models (Big Five, DISC) and infers knowledge domains and communication style.
Pass 3 (Schema Validation & Refinement): Validates the generated profile against the Pydantic schema and regenerates any missing or malformed fields.
Output: A versioned, structured PersonaProfile JSON object.
Q&A Generation (answering module):

Input: A PersonaProfile object and a list of Question objects.
Process: The QuestionAnswerer orchestrates the response generation.
The PromptForge creates a persona-aware, chain-of-thought prompt for each question.
The QuestionAnswerer sends prompts in asynchronous batches to the configured LLM provider.
The Draft -> Critique -> Refine self-reflection loop is executed for each answer to enhance quality.
Each generated answer is scored for confidence and cached locally.
Output: A stream of AnsweredQuestion objects.
Consistency Verification (consistency module):

Input: The complete set of AnsweredQuestion objects.
Process: The ConsistencyValidator builds a knowledge graph where questions are nodes and relationships (e.g., related_to, contradicts) are edges. It uses semantic similarity on embeddings and targeted LLM calls to flag pairs of answers with a high contradiction score (> 0.75).
Output: A validation report (validation.html) highlighting potential inconsistencies.
3.0 Core Module Interface Specification

    provenance: Dict[str, Any] = Field(description="Details of the generation process, including critique.")
    timestamp: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow)

5.0 Prompt Engineering & Reasoning Strategy
The core of the system's intelligence lies in its prompting. A central PromptForge class will manage and version all prompts.

Key Strategies:

Role-Based Prompting: Every prompt begins with a clear system message defining the AI's role (e.g., You are a Persona Architect AI, You are simulating an AI agent named...).
Chain of Thought (CoT) Scaffolding: For complex reasoning, prompts will include instructions to "think step-by-step" and structure the output, which is then parsed.
Self-Critique Loop: The Draft -> Critique -> Refine chain is the default reasoning strategy for all 1000-question answers.
Draft Prompt: "Answer the following question from the persona's perspective. Be concise and direct."
Critique Prompt: "You are a consistency checker. Analyze the following question and answer pair. Identify any contradictions with the persona profile, logical fallacies, or lack of depth. Provide a bulleted list of flaws."
Refine Prompt: "Rewrite the original answer, directly addressing every point raised in the critique. Integrate the feedback to create a more consistent, nuanced, and high-quality final response."
Dynamic Few-Shot Examples: The PromptForge will dynamically inject high-confidence, previously answered questions from the same category into the prompt as few-shot examples to guide the model's tone and structure.
6.0 Operational & Deployment Plan
6.1 CLI Interface (Typer)
The primary interface will be a CLI tool, as defined in the enhancement spec.

persona_builder init: Sets up the directory structure and default configuration.
persona_builder profile [CHAT_FILE] --data-sources [email,github]: Generates the persona profile from one or more sources.
persona_builder answer [PROFILE_FILE] --questions [all|100|IDs] --provider [openai|anthropic]: Runs the question-answering pipeline.
persona_builder validate [ANSWERS_FILE] --report [report.html]: Runs the consistency checker and generates an HTML report.
6.2 Containerization (Docker)
A Dockerfile will be provided to package the application with all its dependencies, allowing for isolated and reproducible execution.

Code snippet

FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY ./persona_builder ./persona_builder
COPY ./source_data ./source_data

ENTRYPOINT ["python", "-m", "persona_builder.cli"]
6.3 API (Optional - FastAPI)
A lightweight fastapi_wrapper.py can be created to expose the core modules (profiler, answerer) via REST endpoints for integration with a web front-end.

This document provides a sufficient level of detail for an advanced AI or a skilled engineering team to begin construction. It establishes clear contracts between modules, defines data structures, and outlines the core reasoning logic, minimizing ambiguity and maximizing the potential for a successful build.

Scope  A curated set of high‑leverage prompt patterns the application can issue to its source AI (the model holding archived chat history) to elicit richer self‑knowledge, uncover hidden areas, and structure latent information before answering the Thousand Questions. Each prompt is phrased for direct LLM consumption and tagged with intent, expected output schema, and execution timing within the pipeline.

Excellent. This Persona Seed Prompts Library is a critical component that operationalizes the persona profiling phase with a structured, intelligent methodology. It moves the system from simple inference to active, targeted interrogation of the source material. This is precisely what's needed for a high-fidelity result.

I will now integrate this library and its associated protocols directly into the technical design specification. The document will be updated to version 1.1 to reflect these significant enhancements. The changes will be marked to show how this new information has been woven into the architecture.

Technical Design & Implementation Specification: Sentient Persona Fabricator (SPF)
Document ID: SPF-TDS-20250615-v1.1
Status: [UPDATED] FINAL
Author: O2 Builder (AI Architect)
Key Stakeholders: Genesis Prime Development Team
Relevant Documents: Enhanced AI Persona Builder, Complementary Data Sources, Thousand_Questions_Implementation_Plan.md, Persona Seed Prompts Library
1.0 Principle Directives
This system will be constructed upon six core principles:

Fidelity & Consistency: The primary goal is to produce a high-fidelity persona whose answers are internally consistent.
Depth & Nuance [NEW]: The system must move beyond surface-level traits to uncover latent values, cognitive biases, and logical inconsistencies within the source data. The Persona Seed Prompts Library is the primary mechanism for achieving this directive.
Scalability & Resilience: All processing shall be asynchronous, batched, cached, and resumable.
Modularity & Extensibility: Each component must be a self-contained, swappable module.
Observability: The system's internal state must be transparent through structured logging, metrics, and reporting.
Privacy & Security by Design: Every data pipeline must include hooks for PII redaction, consent management, and provenance tracking.
2.0 System Architecture & Data Flow
The data flow remains sequential, but the "Persona Profiling" stage is now significantly more sophisticated.

[UPDATED] 2. Persona Profiling (profiling module):

Input: A collection of Document objects.
Process: The PersonaProfiler executes a configurable sequence of prompts from the Persona Seed Prompts Library (see Appendix D). This is no longer a simple three-pass summary but a deep analysis designed to extract multi-faceted traits. Example steps include:
P-07 (Emotional Baseline): Calculates sentiment trends.
P-02 (Values Hierarchy): Ranks implicit values.
P-01 (Blind-Spot Discovery): Identifies cognitive blind spots (requires user consent).
The results from each prompt are progressively merged into a single, rich persona object.
A final validation pass ensures the completed object conforms to the PersonaProfile schema.
Output: A versioned, structured PersonaProfile JSON object containing both explicit traits and deep-level insights.
3.0 Core Module Interface Specification
3.1 profiling Module [UPDATED]
Purpose: To create a structured, multi-layered persona profile by executing a series of analytical prompts on unstructured text.
Primary Class: PersonaProfiler(llm_adapter: BaseLLM, prompt_manager: PromptManager)
Input Schema: List[Document], List[str] (a list of Seed Prompt IDs to execute, e.g., ['P-02', 'P-07']).
Output Schema: PersonaProfile (see updated Section 4.0).
Core Logic (Orchestration of Seed Prompts):
Code snippet

function create_profile(documents, prompt_ids_to_run):
  // Initialize an empty profile object
  profile = PersonaProfile()

  // Load the full chat history as a single context block
  full_context = combine_documents_into_text(documents)

  // Sequentially execute the configured seed prompts
  for prompt_id in prompt_ids_to_run:
    // Get the prompt template from the library
    prompt_template = prompt_manager.get_seed_prompt(prompt_id)

    // Populate the prompt with the context
    prompt = prompt_template.format(chat_archive=full_context)

    // Execute the LLM call
    response_text = llm.generate(prompt, response_format="json") // Assuming JSON output
    response_data = json.loads(response_text)

    // Merge the new data into the main profile object
    update_profile_with_data(profile, prompt_id, response_data)

  // Run a final pass to generate the narrative summary based on all collected data
  summary_prompt = prompt_manager.get_seed_prompt("PROFILE_NARRATIVE_SYNTHESIS", profile.dict())
  profile.narrative_summary = llm.generate(summary_prompt)

  // Validate the final, merged object against the Pydantic schema
  profile.model_validate(profile)
  return profile
3.2 prompting Module (Formerly prompting.forge) [UPDATED]
Purpose: To manage, version, and compose all system prompts from a centralized library.
Primary Class: PromptManager(library_path: str)
Core Logic:
Loads all prompt skeletons from a configuration directory (e.g., YAML or JSON files).
Provides methods to retrieve and format prompts by ID.
get_seed_prompt(prompt_id: str, context: dict) -> str: Retrieves and formats a persona-profiling prompt from the library.
get_answer_prompt(prompt_id: str, context: dict) -> str: Retrieves and formats a question-answering prompt (for the Draft, Critique, Refine loop).
4.0 Data Schemas & Models (Pydantic) [UPDATED]
The PersonaProfile schema is expanded to store the outputs of the new seed prompts.

Python

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Literal, Optional

# --- Sub-models for Seed Prompt Outputs ---
class BlindSpot(BaseModel):
    blind_spot: str
    rationale: str
    first_step: str

class ValueHierarchyItem(BaseModel):
    value: str
    rank: int
    evidence_quote: str

# --- Main Persona Profile ---
class PersonaProfile(BaseModel):
    schema_version: str = "1.1" # Version updated
    profile_id: str = Field(default_factory=lambda: f"persona_{uuid.uuid4().hex}")
    name: str

5.0 Prompt & Reasoning Strategy [UPDATED]
The system's reasoning is now a two-phase process: Profiling and Answering.

5.1 Persona Profiling via Seed Library
Before any questions are answered, the system performs deep profiling using the Persona Seed Prompts Library (detailed in Appendix D). This library contains a curated set of prompts designed to extract a multi-dimensional understanding of the persona. This step is foundational; it ensures the AI has a rich, structured "self-concept" before it begins the introspective task of answering the 1000 questions.

5.2 Question Answering via Self-Critique
The Draft -> Critique -> Refine loop remains the core strategy for answering the 1000 questions. However, the context available to the PromptManager is now significantly richer, including the detailed PersonaProfile generated in the profiling phase. This allows for prompts that are not just persona-aware, but also deeply self-aware of the persona's identified blind spots, values, and inconsistencies.

8.0 Operational & Deployment Plan [UPDATED]
8.1 CLI Interface (Typer)
The CLI will be updated to support the new profiling capabilities.

persona_builder profile [CHAT_FILE]: Now accepts new flags.
--deep-profile: A boolean flag to enable the execution of potentially sensitive or computationally expensive seed prompts (e.g., P-01, P-03, P-04).
--consent-given: An explicit flag required to run prompts tagged as requiring user opt-in (e.g., Blind-Spot Discovery). The application will exit with an error if a sensitive prompt is requested without this flag.
8.4 [NEW] Operational Protocols for Seed Prompts
The usage guidelines from the library are formalized as operational requirements:

Consent Management: The CLI and any future API must implement a consent check before executing prompts tagged with requires_consent=true in the prompt library configuration.
Throttling & Caching: The results of seed prompts will be cached in a local SQLite database (analysis_cache.db) keyed by (source_data_hash, prompt_id). The system will refuse to re-run computationally expensive prompts (e.g., P-01) on the same data within a configurable 24-hour window.
Safety & Moderation: All generated text from free-form prompts (e.g., Blind-Spot Discovery) must pass through a content moderation filter before being saved to the persona profile.
[NEW] Appendix D: Persona Seed Prompts Library v0.1
This library contains a curated set of high-leverage prompt patterns to elicit richer self-knowledge from the source chat history.
